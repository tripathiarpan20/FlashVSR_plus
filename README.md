## Project Background
FlashVSR was generously released via [OpenImagingLab](https://github.com/OpenImagingLab/FlashVSR) to the open-source community. Their team's README is detailed below!

This project builds upon this excellent fork [lihaoyun6/FlashVSR_plus](https://github.com/lihaoyun6/FlashVSR_plus), which introduced several key optimizations to the original FlashVSR project

### Features from Upstream Fork
The FlashVSR_plus fork laid the groundwork with several notable enhancements, including:
* Replaced Block-Sparse-Attention with Sparse_SageAttention.
* Added DiT tiling and other memory optimizations to significantly reduce VRAM requirements.
* Implemented the initial Gradio user interface.

## Enhancements in This Version
This fork further refines the user experience and expands functionality with a focus on quality-of-life improvements and adds several new tools.

* Enhanced Gradio UI: The interface has been redesigned for a more intuitive workflow, including dedicated tabs for additional tasks.
* Improved Memory Management and optimizations and internal fixes to ensure smooth operation on consumer hardware.
* Chunked Video Processing: Easily upscale longer videos without running into memory limitations.
* Image Upscaling: A new feature that brings the power of FlashVSR to still images.
* Post-Processing Toolbox: A suite of useful post-processing tools for RIFE frame interpolation, seamless video looping, and extra compression/export options.

### 🌟 Abstract

Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving **efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance**. To this end, we propose **FlashVSR**, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. **FlashVSR runs at ∼17 FPS for 768 × 1408 videos on a single A100 GPU** by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts redundant computation while bridging the train–test resolution gap, and (iii) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct **VSR-120K**, a new dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves **state-of-the-art performance with up to ∼12× speedup** over prior one-step diffusion VSR models.

### 🛠️ Method

The overview of **FlashVSR**. This framework features:

* **Three-Stage Distillation Pipeline** for streaming VSR training.
* **Locality-Constrained Sparse Attention** to cut redundant computation and bridge the train–test resolution gap.
* **Tiny Conditional Decoder** for efficient, high-quality reconstruction.
* **VSR-120K Dataset** consisting of **120k videos** and **180k images**, supports joint training on both images and videos.
